# Noapoleon's dotfiles
I like manual configs :]

# Components
 - **Shell**: zsh/oh-my-zsh)
 - **Editor**: neovim
 - **Terminal multiplexer**: Tmux
 - **Font**: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

# Todo
### Repo
- [ ] Better README.md formatting, add links, images, etc.

### Nvim
- [ ] Investigate alternatives to neo-tree, fuzzy-finder doesn't seem to work

### Zsh
- [ ] Look into zinit and ohmyposh more
- [ ] Can ohmyposh be used with ohmyzsh?
- [ ] Move git branch name to top of prompt bar (or not, idk)
